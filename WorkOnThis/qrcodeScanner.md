✅ Great — let’s do a **clear comparison** of `html5-qrcode` vs `react-qr-reader` for QR code scanning in web apps.

---

# 📷 1️⃣ `html5-qrcode`

### ➡️ What is it?

✅ A pure JavaScript / TypeScript library to scan QR codes (or barcodes) directly in the browser using the camera.

👉 It’s framework-agnostic: works with **Vanilla JS, React, Angular, Vue, etc.**

### ➡️ Functionality & Features

* Uses `getUserMedia` to access camera.
* Continuously scans frames to decode QR codes.
* Can scan from:
  * **Live camera feed**
  * **Uploaded images / files**
* Very customizable scanning parameters (fps, facing mode, etc).
* Good support for error handling and torch control (on supported devices).

### ➡️ Uses

* Build **browser-based QR code scanning** for:
  * Ticket verification
  * Attendance systems
  * Payments
  * Check-ins / access control.

### ➡️ Pros

✅ Very flexible (works outside React too).

✅ Supports **multi-format scanning** (QR, barcodes).

✅ Can scan from files.

✅ More updates and documentation.

### ➡️ Cons

🚩 Not a React component out-of-the-box — requires you to manually integrate with refs or IDs in React.

---

# ⚛️ 2️⃣ `react-qr-reader`

### ➡️ What is it?

✅ A **React component wrapper** around `jsQR` or similar libraries.

It gives you a **plug-and-play React component** to scan QR codes.

### ➡️ Functionality & Features

* Simple React usage: just drop `<QrReader />`.
* Supports scanning from:
  * **Live camera stream** only (many versions do not have file input).
* Easy callbacks like `onScan` or `onError`.

### ➡️ Uses

* Quickly embed QR scanning in a React project with  **minimal code** .

### ➡️ Pros

✅ Extremely easy in React.

✅ React states & hooks friendly.

### ➡️ Cons

🚩 Less customizable.

🚩 Limited to QR codes (not generic barcodes).

🚩 Some versions are outdated, have issues with camera switching or missing mobile torch toggle.

🚩 Harder to add scanning from  **uploaded images** .

# ⚔️ `html5-qrcode` vs `react-qr-reader`

| Feature                           | `html5-qrcode`                     | `react-qr-reader`             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Framework                         | Vanilla JS / React / any             | React only                      |
| Supports uploaded images?         | ✅ Yes                               | 🚫 Mostly no                    |
| Torch / camera controls           | ✅ Yes (torch on/off, select camera) | 🚫 Usually no                   |
| Multiple barcode formats          | ✅ Yes (QR, bar, etc)                | 🚫 Usually QR only              |
| Custom scanning config (fps, etc) | ✅ Yes                               | 🚫 Limited                      |
| Ease of use in React              | ⚠️ Needs extra work                | ✅ Very easy (`<QrReader />`) |
| Active maintenance                | ✅ More active                       | ⚠️ Less frequent              |

# 🚀 Which one is **better** & more  **secure** ?

✅ For **professional, production-grade scanning** (like ticket validation at your event):

* **`html5-qrcode` is better.**
  * You can customize it fully, turn on torch on mobile, switch cameras, scan from file uploads, and it handles more use cases.
  * It’s also actively maintained and has a large community.

✅ If you just want **quick, simple scanning inside React** with minimal setup:

* **`react-qr-reader` is simpler** , but be ready for limitations.

---

# 🔒 What about  **security** ?

Neither library directly handles **security of the scanned data** — that’s up to your backend.

✅ The camera access is secure by browser permissions (https & getUserMedia).

✅ You must validate / verify any QR data on your server (for example using signatures or hashes inside your QR codes).

---

# 🚀 **Recommended for your use case**

✅ Since your platform needs  **admin ticket scanning** , possibly switching cameras, maybe scanning offline tickets via uploaded images —

👉 **Use `html5-qrcode`.**

You can still integrate it nicely inside React using `useRef` + `useEffect`.

---

🎯 If you want, I can give you:

✅ A **React wrapper example** for `html5-qrcode` with custom UI

✅ Or a **direct `react-qr-reader` example** side by side to compare.
